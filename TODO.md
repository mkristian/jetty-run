# TODOs #

* use thor for CLI
* move the jetty config away from maven/tools/rails_project.rb
* use its own .jetty-pom.xml instead of .pom.xml from 'rmvn'
* keep the certificate-store here and the jetty-overwrite.xml should be in that gem as well
* move the web.xml into maven-tools - needed or rails war packaging
