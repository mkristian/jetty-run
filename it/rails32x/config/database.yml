# If you are using mssql, derby, hsqldb, h2 or oracle with one of the
# ActiveRecord JDBC adapters, configure your database setting as the
# example below. (Note that for oracle you will need to include the
# driver jar on the classpath.):
#
#development:
#  adapter: mssql
#  username: <username>
#  password: <password>
#  host: localhost
#  database: dummy

# If you are using db2, sybase, informix or prefer to directly specify
# the JDBC connection information, configure your database setting as
# the example below (requires you to download and manually install the
# database vendor's JDBC driver .jar file). See your driver
# documentation for the apropriate driver class and connection string:
#
#development:
#  adapter: jdbc
#  username: <username>
#  password: <password>
#  driver: com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
#  url: jdbc:db2://localhost:5021/dummy

# SQLite version 3.x
#   gem install sqlite3
#
#   Ensure the SQLite 3 gem is defined in your Gemfile
#   gem 'sqlite3'
development:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/development.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
test:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/test.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000

production:
  adapter: sqlite3
  database: db/production.sqlite3
  pool: 5
  timeout: 5000
